# Description
Accuaim is a shot-tracking application. We want to provide users with a way to track their shooting accuracy during any given shooting session and get accurate, tangible data back. The application tracks shot placement and speed and will provide the user with analytics after their session ends, providing athletes with a way to track their progression over time or challenge themselves to hit a certain percentage or milestone on any given day. This includes shooting percentages, heatmaps, etc. Users can sign up with an email and password (passwords are encrypted and stored safely), and begin right away. 

Core app functions completed: 
- Login, Sign up, Sign in, Delete Account
- Starting a new session, customizing blocks
- Viewing old sessions and their respective data
- Updating user info (Name, email, password, etc.)

Potential features to be added:
- Explore page, where you can view, save, and do other users' shooting workouts they have shared
- Friends system, see who's best at a given location on the cage, compete to get the highest percentage in a given workout
- Leaderboard system, goes hand in hand with friends system, see best "scores' on a shooting workout


Waiting on prototype to test and further develop, catered to the technology itself.
