# Description
Accuaim is a shot-tracking application. Its goal is to provide users with a way to track their shooting accuracy during any given shooting session. The application tracks shot placement and speed and will provide the user with analytics after their session ends. This includes shooting percentages, heatmaps, etc. More details to come.
